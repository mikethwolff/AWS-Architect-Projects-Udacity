## Project 1: Data Durability And Recovery

In this project you will create highly available solutions to common use cases. You will build a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. You will also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.

There will be three parts to this project:

* Data Durability And Recovery
Pick two AWS regions. An active region and a standby region. Use CloudFormation to create one VPC in each region.

**Solution:** [Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation](https://github.com/mikethwolff/...))
